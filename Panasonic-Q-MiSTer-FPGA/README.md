# Panasonic Q MiSTer FPGA
### Introduction
A couple of years ago I created a MiSTer FPG case using an old Panasonic Q GameCube case.  I purched a broken Panasonic Q on ebay and gutted it, preserving the case.  I sold the extra parts on ebay and they were used to fix another broken Panasonic Q, so all is good there.

What I did to hook this up:
1. I drilled out the GameCube controller ports and put USB ones in there place to hook up to the MiSTer USB ports.
2. I wired the Panasonic Q's front butten pannels to the MiSTer.
3. I took out the GameCube's memory card port and instead put in an SD card reader wired up to the MiSTer.
4. I took out the GameCube's digital out port and replaced it with an HDMI port.
5. I added a VGA and CAT5 network ports to the Panasonic Q's rear and hooked them up to MiSTer.
6. I wired the existing Panasonic Q's audio out pots to the MiSTer audio channels.
